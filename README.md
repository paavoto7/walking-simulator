# Walking simulator

This project is copied from my repository I used to learn OpenGL with [learnopengl.com](learnopengl.com).
Now other details such as heightmap reading, coloring it based on height, jumping and such have been added.
The features are still very rudimentary, but I hope I can make a nice little walking simulator out of this.
(Not those demos you see in YouTube that made in Unreal Engine by shading experts)
