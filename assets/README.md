## Assets
The assets directory contains a single 3D flower model that I created myself using Blender. Please note that
I am unable to include the textures used during development due to potential copyright concerns. I also have not yet created
my own heightmap or skybox images. The ones I used during development were from [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/),
and therefore I cannot redistribute them here.
